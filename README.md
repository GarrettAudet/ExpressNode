LocalLibrary is an Express.js web application designed to simulate the operations of a small local library. This project serves as an educational tool for demonstrating key features of web development with Express. The application starts as a browse-only catalog where users can view available books and expands to incorporate features like book management, user authentication, and form handling. This scalable example provides a foundational understanding of database interactions, routing, and server-side logic essential for building dynamic websites.
