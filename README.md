LocalLibrary is an Express.js web application designed to simulate the operations of a small local library. This project serves as an educational tool for demonstrating key features of web development with Express. The application starts as a browse-only catalog where users can view available books and expands to incorporate features like book management, user authentication, and form handling. This project provides an example of database interactions, routing, and server-side logic.
